ZGM Allocator, a fast and efficient memory allocator
========================================

This was my intership during my masters and the purpose was to replace the naive and in-efficient Memory Allocator used in
the AXIOM project (which was based on LMM if it replaced now or not).

Another important purpose was for me to understand well how memory allocator works and how to investigate, optimize, and write my own allocator.

The performance of the memory allocator presented in the two pdf documents is not the current, as the current results are shown below :

presented results are not the latest, will be updated later

## Notes

* most of scripts and code are inside the pdf documents.
